        <h3>Baldur's Gate</h3>
        <p class="lore">Rising along the Sword Coast where the Chionthar meets the sea, Baldur’s Gate is a city of towering walls, clashing ambitions, and ceaseless trade. Its streets teem with sailors, merchants, and schemers alike, while the Flaming Fist enforces order with coin-backed steel. Beneath the grandeur of the Upper City and the sprawl of the Lower, whispers of corruption and ancient threats coil through alleys and cellars, reminding all that power here is never without a price.</p>
        <p class="hooks"><strong>Hooks:</strong> Some citizens secretly bear strange parasites that grant uncanny powers, while others fear a growing mind flayer presence beneath the city.</p>
        <p class="hooks"><strong>Hooks:</strong> Massive arcane constructs patrol certain districts, enforcing law with brutal efficiency and answering to someone beyond the Flaming Fist.</p>
        <p class="hooks"><strong>Hooks:</strong> Forgotten prisons, flooded vaults, and infernal bargains lie buried under Baldur’s Gate, some still holding prisoners who should not exist.</p>
